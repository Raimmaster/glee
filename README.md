Hapi boilerplate with glue, jest, ES6+ (stage-3), build scripts and everything you need to quick-start backend development with Flow type checking.

Provides a basic Rest API template:

+ ES6 + babel,
  + Removes Flow type annotations,
  + Transforms imports to lazy CommonJS requires,
  + Transforms async/await to generators,
+ [ESLint][eslint] with the [airbnb-base][airbnb-base] and [flowtype][eslint-flowtype] rules,
+ [Jest][jest] unit testing and coverage,
+ [Type definitions][flow-typed] for Jest,
+ [NPM scripts for common operations](#available-scripts),
+ [.editorconfig][editorconfig] for consistent file format,
+ [Yarn][yarn] lockfile so only verified and up-to-date dependencies are installed.
+ Guidance for CQRS architecture.

## Quick start

This project requires [Node.js][nodejs] 6.9 (LTS) or later (but should work with any 6.2 or newer release) and [NPM][npm], [Yarn][yarn] is optional but recommended. Make sure you have those installed. Then just type following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/acklenavenue/glee
cd node-flowtype-boilerplate
yarn
```

or if you don't have yarn installed

```
npm install
```

## Available scripts

Run using either `npm run <script>` or `yarn run <script>` comand.

+ `clean` - remove coverage data, Jest cache and transpiled files,
+ `lint` - lint source files and tests,
+ `typecheck` - check type annotations,
+ `test` - lint, typecheck and run tests with coverage,
+ `test-only` - run tests with coverage,
+ `test:watch` - interactive watch mode to automatically re-run tests, 
+ `build` - compile source files,
+ `build:watch` - interactive watch mode, compile sources on change.

## Inspiration

This boilerplate was initially inspired by [Jakub Synowiec](https://github.com/acklenavenue/glee), but taken several steps further to include a basic Hapi-based REST API with CQRS-style command dispatching.
